# Anti-Drone Challenge

## Overview
The Anti-Drone Challenge aims to develop an advanced system for detecting, tracking, and neutralizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system integrates multiple technologies to provide robust surveillance and countermeasure capabilities.

## Key Focus Areas

### A. Drone Detection and Tracking Methods
To effectively identify and monitor UAV activity, the system incorporates:
- **Radar Systems** – Detect and track drones using radar waves.
- **AI-Powered Cameras** – Utilize computer vision and machine learning for drone identification.
- **Thermal Imaging** – Detect heat signatures to locate drones in various lighting conditions.
- **Acoustic Sensors** – Capture and analyze sound patterns associated with UAVs.
- **Radio Frequency (RF) Detection** – Monitor communication signals to identify drone activity.

### B. Countermeasure Techniques
Once a drone is detected, the system employs various strategies to neutralize threats:
- **RF Jamming** – Disrupts drone communication by transmitting interference signals.
- **GPS Spoofing** – Manipulates the drone's navigation system to misdirect or disable it.
- **Drone Interception** – Deploys defensive UAVs or physical methods to capture rogue drones.
- **Directed Energy Weapons** – Uses high-energy lasers or microwave systems to disable UAVs.

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular design, integrating multiple components:
1. **AI & Machine Learning Module** – Handles drone recognition and classification.
2. **Sensor Integration** – Aggregates data from radar, cameras, RF scanners, and acoustic sensors.
3. **Countermeasure Control** – Manages and executes neutralization techniques.
4. **Command & Control Interface** – Provides real-time monitoring and response capabilities.

## Technologies Used --> Might be changed later
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **AI & ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Sensor Integration**: ROS (Robot Operating System), GNU Radio
- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Flask

## Deployment
The system can be deployed in various environments, including:
- Military bases
- Critical infrastructure protection
- Public events
- Private security applications
